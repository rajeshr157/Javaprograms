11. Niven Number : List all Niven numbers between 1 and 1000
Description: 
Niven Number is a number  that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
Ex:
The number 18 is a Niven number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 8 is 9 (1 + 8 = 9), and 18 is divisible by 9 (since 18 % 9 = 0)
The number 1729 is a Niven number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 ,7, 2 and 9 is 19 (1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19), and 1729 is divisible by 19 (1729 = 19 * 91)

20. Remove all the leading spaces except 1 between words in a sentence and print it
Ex: "     The     dog    leaped over the      fence    ."
should become
"The dog leaped over the fence"

21. Find the sum of digits in the given String 
Ex: In string "SanKir345Tech123" 
sum of digits is : 3+4+5+1+2+3 = 18

22. Count the number of vowels, consonants( non-vowels), digits and space in given string 
hint: use scanner.nextLine ( for string input as it takes spaces in between )

Ex: In String "aieou aieou sdfgh 12345 12345 sdfgh" - count is as follows 
vowels - 10, consonants-10, digits-10 spaces - 5 

23. Given Array of String - claculate - Each string length and number of words in each string
Ex: Strin[] strarry = { "First line of file", "Second week", "Third month of the year 2020", "Fourth Semester of the Computer science in College",
			"Fifth avenue in the downtown" }
